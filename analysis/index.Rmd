Turns out new genes might frequently be generated through frameshift duplication events. Here I analyze the results of TBLASTX run of all human genes against all other human genes, isolating hits that are out of frame from one another.

### Workflow

* [Analyze frameshifts](analyze_frameshifts.html)

* [Aging frameshifted genes](aging.html)

* [Making final tables](final_tables.html)
