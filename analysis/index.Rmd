Turns out new genes might frequently be generated through frameshift duplication events. Here I analyze the results of TBLASTX run of all human genes against all other human genes, isolating hits that are out of frame from one another.

### Workflow

* [Parse BLAST results](parse_blast.html)

* [Analyze frameshifts](analyze_frameshifts.html)

* [Aging frameshifted genes](aging.html)

* [Making final tables](final_tables.html)

### ToDo

1. Split GO analyses into parent offspring genes and compare
  * Does not result in enrichment

2. Add more species - amphioxus, corn worm, nematostella, trichoplax
  * Are not available through Biomart

### Resources

Other resources to try:
